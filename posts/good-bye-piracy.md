When I graduated from the university twenty-one years ago, I was full of aspirations
to take the media world by a storm, but hardly had I completed the compulsory 
National Youth Service than the reality set in. Publishers were ready to buy my 
scripts at the price of a bag of rice. Imagine the script that took me almost a year to
complete. The script I had thought would fetch me lovely a car and a beautiful 
office. 

Getting my script published was I like getting stuck between the troops of Pharaoh 
and the scary Red Sea. “Your script is one of the best.” A publisher once told me 
with a wry smile on his face and a voiced laced with a repulsive authority. He loaded
me with the pathetic stories of how pirates had ruined his publishing business 
several times. “As you can see, I won’t be able to pay you what you think you 
deserve. Even a professor never earned that much as a writer.” He added and 
ended the conversation with me. I had my ego busted and I left his office with my 
head bowed. 

At last, I got the book published within a year, but truly without the anticipated 
profit by selling the copyright outright instead of waiting for a royalty that would 
never be paid with sincerity. After that, I wanted to attempt self-publishing, but the 
fear of the pirates is the beginning of retreat. So, I never bothered to write again 
except love letters to my First Lady. You are probably laughing at me now and 
possibly calling me a coward. All I will say is ‘thank you!’ Even though ‘e dey sweet you’, let’s leave my story now and talk about other victims. 

Have you ever wondered why most film producers in Nigeria no longer care 
about putting their products in DVDs and CDs? Have you ever wondered why many elite musicians of recent times would rather put their energy into concerts without bothering about releasing new albums?
The answer is not far-fetched, there is always a group of heartless souls who will be 
waiting around the corner, lurking and waiting for the ‘right’ time to pounce on 
another man’s sweat.

Piracy stings with a killer dose of venom. Diligent and 
talented artistes die in abject poverty why lazy pirates live in affluence. They invest 
in huge and ultramodern equipment just to make a mass production of another 
man’s intellectual property without a legal permission. 

Every attempt made by the government to curb this menace is always abortive, and
everybody now seems to be bereft of the right ideas to solve this lingering problem.
Maybe we have accepted it as our fate.
