In this part of the world, society has molded many people to hinge their success on 
sweat and certificates. Consequently, little efforts are placed on skills and talent 
development. A few people who strive to follow their passion and earn a living 
through it often hit brick walls due to lack of a well-structured support via which 
they can birth their dreams, either lofty or miniature. However, it is very true that 
some Nigerian youths like Davido, Wizkid, Lil Kesh, Olamide etc. are able to make a 
mark in the same scenario of limited opportunities where many others have failed 
and are still failing. 

But the big question is this: what is the percentage of those who
were able to achieve success compared to the percentage of those who failed 
woefully and withdrew into their shells - never to make any attempt again? Do you 
know how many wonderful scripts that never got published, how many beautiful 
lyrics that never became songs, how many amazing screenplays that never became
movies?  Hmmm... e choke you, abi? Na so me sef dey feel am for here too.

Two days ago, I promised to bring you more details about Hooter, the world’s best
