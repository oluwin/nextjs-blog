**“I never wanted to be the next Bruce Lee. I just wanted to be the first Jackie Chan.”**
\
**- Jackie Chan**

The above quote by Jackie Chan has in it an embodiment of double fact: 
First, it shows us a man who was not ready to be a continuum of another 
man’s legacy. Secondly, it shows us a man who was determined to make a 
new mark and dominate the scene with his own lasting legacies.

Little wonder, Jackie Chan surmounted many challenges in order to fulfil his 
dreams and become one of the best ever in the history of cinema. And you, 
wouldn’t you rather step out of that shadow and take charge of your world. 

You can simply be the first you, if you are determined to make it happen.
The arrival of Hooter is an indication of our own readiness to be the new first 
in global media technology – first in uncompromised content protection, first 
in quality picture and sound, first in business development opportunities, 
first in real-time delivery of users’ earnings, first in global reach and 
customer care.

Now, wouldn’t you grab the opportunity to be the first on **Hooter.tv**  – the 
first film producer, the first writer, the first actor, the first comedian, the first 
musician, the first poet, the first lecturer, the first preacher, the first online 
trainer, the first dancer... the list is endless.
